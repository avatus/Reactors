## Random Forest with Classification and Clustering - Human Activity Predictor

Contoso Behavior Systems is developing an AI tool that will try to predict human activity (1-Walking, 2-Walking upstairs, 3-Walking downstairs, 4-Sitting, 5-Standing or 6-Laying) by using the smartphone’s sensors. Meaning that by using the following methods, the smartphone can detect what we are doing at the moment.

In this project, we calculate a mode that will allow a smartphone to detect its owner’s activity precisely. For the dataset, 30 people were used to perform six different activities. Each of them was wearing a smartphone on their waist. Using the smartphone’s embedded sensors (the accelerometer and the gyroscope), the user’s speed and acceleration were measured in three-axial directions. We use the sensor’s data to predict user’s activity. After preparing the datasets and doing some machine learning methods, we find that the random forest method performed the best on predicting the user’s activity by a precision of 93 percent.
