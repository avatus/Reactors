# Connecting and deploying to Ethereum networks

Ethereum is a protocol with multiple independent networks that conform to this protocol.

Networks are different Ethereum environments you can access for development, testing, or production use cases. It’s helpful to have a good understanding of the different networks that Ethereum provides and how to work with the networks of your choice. For whatever solution you have, you’re going to need to choose if you will have a private or public solution and how to go from a development to test network to production network.

The goal is to get more familiar with the network options, some tools you can use to interact with them, and learn how to connect and deploy to different networks.

The following sections are included:

1. Start with an overview of [public networks](public-networks.md) of mainnet and testnet.
1. Then learn more about the [private networks](private-networks.md) available including development and consortiums.
1. Learn about what is required to [prepare for and deploy to mainnet](prepare-for-mainnet.md).
1. Then walk through an exercise to [develop a task manager todo list and deploy to development](deploy-development.md).
1. And then [deploy to the Ropsten network](deploy-ropsten.md).
1. Challenge: After you've completed all the previous sections, go through an exercise to [deploy to a private Ethereum network](deploy-private-network.md).
