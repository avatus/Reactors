Public, Private and Hybrid/Consortium Blockchain
------------------------------------------------

There are several types of blockchains that manage the way that the blockchains are accessed and utilized as well as how the blockchains perform and whether the blockchain will be public, private or a hybrid.

-   **Public blockchains** are broadly available.

    -   Anyone can access transaction history, create new transactions, and validate them into new blocks.

    -   No need for trust, everything is recorded on the blockchain.

    -   Higher level of security since the more people using the blockchain, the more difficult it is to attack.

    -   Transparency of public blockchain increases potential use cases.

-   **Private/permissioned blockchains** provide infrastructure, handling and validating data transactions.

    -   Cost-effective because they don't require mining based consensus mechanisms and provide overall management over transactions within the chain.

    -   Only allows certain entities to participate.

    -   Participants are granted specific rights and restrictions in the network, so someone could have full access or limited access at the discretion of the network.

    -   More centralized in nature as only a small group controls the network.

    -   Private blockchains have fewer participants and thus are faster to achieve consensus.

    -   Private blockchains are more scalable since only a few nodes are authorized and responsible for managing data, the network is able to process more transactions.

-   **Hybrid/Consortium** blockchains are a combination of private and public blockchains.

    -   Used by a group of organizations that work jointly on developing different solutions.

    -   Restricted-access blockchain, each organization is able to maintain its intellectual property rights within the consortium.

    -   Hybrid between low-trust public blockchains and the highly-trusted private blockchains.

    -   The consortium is permissioned for a predetermined group of enterprises.

    -   It is semi-decentralized and under the supervision of a limited set of members.

    -   Utilizes multi-party consensus in that all operations are
        verified by special pre-approved nodes, not by the world
        community, like in bitcoin blockchain.

Some commonly used blockchains include:

-   [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/intro-to-ethereum/): A public blockchain which is shared and utilized across a global network.

    -   Each new block is added utilizing the proof of work consensus model.

-   [Azure Blockchain Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/blockchain/): A fully managed ledger service that enables users the ability to grow and operate blockchain networks at scale in Azure.

-   [Multichain](https://www.multichain.com/): MultiChain helps organizations to build and deploy blockchain applications.

-   [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu): Designed to be enterprise-friendly for both public and private permissioned network use cases.
