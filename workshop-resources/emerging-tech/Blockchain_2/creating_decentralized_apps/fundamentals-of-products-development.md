Fundamentals of Blockchain Products and Development
---------------------------------------------------

Blockchain products are useful for a variety of applications ranging from supply-chain management to decentralized finance. Blockchain technology cuts across a variety of markets and geographies. As the utilization of blockchain, distributed ledger and decentralized technologies has evolved, so has the development of blockchains that support enterprises, financial institutions and global networks.

The benefits of developing decentralized programs supports building applications and infrastructures for a variety of use cases. When architecting blockchain products, it's important to use the best suited tools and platforms.

The primary reasons for creating blockchain products include:

-   Public verifiability since smart contracts are visible and auditable on the blockchain.

-   Transparency-based data and the process of updating the state is a requirement for public verifiability.

-   Integrity of information ensures that it is protected from unauthorized modifications.

-   Redundancy is inherently provided through replication across the writers. In centralized systems, redundancy is generally achieved through replication on different physical servers and through backups.

-   Trust anchor defines who represents the highest authority of a given system that is entitled to grant and revoke read and write system access.

-   Valid network environments ensure that exchanged information, file storage and other transactions among devices are carried out in a reliable and transparent manner.
