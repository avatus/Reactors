Technologies for building an Ethereum Decentralized Application
---------------------------------------------------------------

Underlying Technologies for managing the frontend apps which interact with the smart contacts can communicate via an API using a JSON-RPC layer called the Web3 API.

-   [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is a stateless, light-weight remote procedure call (RPC) protocol using JSON for the payload.

-   [Web3](http://web3) is the Ethereum compatible javascript API and bindings which is built using the JSON-RPC spec. Any decentralized app can use this s Web3.js for browser based DApps.

-   [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

-   [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

The [Truffle Framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), which provides a set of tools and boilerplate code for developing Ethereum DApps and is integrated with [Microsoft's VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) [Blockchain development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AzBlockchain.azure-blockchain).

-   [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/overview) is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Truffle provides:

    -   Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.

    -   Automated contract testing for rapid development.

    -   Scriptable, extensible deployment & migrations framework.

    -   Network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.

    -   Package management with EthPM & NPM, using the ERC190 standard.

    -   Interactive console for direct contract communication.

    -   Configurable build pipeline with support for tight integration.

    -   External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

-   [Truffle Boxes](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes) are boilerplates that can contain helpful modules, Solidity contracts & libraries, front-end views and more; all the way up to complete example dapps.

-   [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/ganache/overview) provides a personal blockchain that can be used for developing and testing Dapps. This tutorial will be using the ganache CLI (Command Line Interface) personal blockchain for testing and deploying smart contracts, but you can feel free to use [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) app as an alternate option.

-   [Drizzle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/drizzle/overview) is a collection of front-end libraries that simplifies the process of writing smart contracts to Dapp front-ends. Drizzle provides the mechanisms for synchronizing and managing contract data and is based on a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store.

-   [Truffle Suite Drizzle Box](https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes/drizzle) comes with the drizzle components required to start using smart contracts from a react app. Unboxing Drizzle will install all necessary dependencies and a **Create-React-App** is generated in the **./app** folder. **Drizzle** extends **web3 1.0**'s contacts and is a collection of libraries to simplify development of your Dapps in Plain JavaScript, React and Vue.

> Drizzle includes the following components:

-   **[@drizzle/store](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/blob/develop/packages/store/README.md):**- is the state manager of Drizzle. It handles the boilerplate for web3 connection as synchronizing Smart Contract state and events.

    -   Fully reactive contract data, including state, events and transactions.

    -   Declarative so as not to waste valuable cycles on unneeded data.

    -   Maintains access to underlying functionality. Web3 and contract's methods are still there, untouched.

-   [**@drizzle/react-plugin**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/tree/master/packages/react-plugin):- defines the Drizzle Provider for a React project.

    -   Abstracts away the boilerplate of creating a dapp front-end
    -   Handles instantiating web3 and contracts, fetching accounts, and keeping all of this data in sync with the blockchain.

-   [**@drizzle/react-components**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/tree/master/packages/react-components):- is a collection of primitive web controls that transforms Smart Contract data types to their appropriate html controls.

    -   Provides a set of useful components for common UI elements.

-   [**@drizzle/vue-plugin**](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/blob/develop/packages/vue-plugin/README.md):- a Vue adaptor and collection of html controls to support developing a Vue dapp.

Below is a good visual representation of how Drizzle works with the dap and keeps track of the data.
