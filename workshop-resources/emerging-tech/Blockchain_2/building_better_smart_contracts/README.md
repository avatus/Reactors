# Building better smart contracts

This workshop focuses on how you can build better smart contracts with Tokens, Oracles, and OpenZeppelin. It includes the following sections.

1. Learn about Solidity [advanced Data Structures](advanced-data-structures.md).

2. Install the development tools you'll need in [getting Setup](getting-setup.md).

3. Understand how to work with off chain data in the [introduction to Oracles](introduction-to-oracles.md).

4. See how to use tokens in contracts in [working with Tokens](working-with-tokens.md).

This workshop assumes you have knowledge of Blockchain fundamentals as well as the Ethereum platform. You should also have experience with writing smart contracts using Solidity.
